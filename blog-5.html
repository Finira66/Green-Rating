                Oil VS Alternative Energy Sources
            </div>

            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                Oil played a key role during the Second Industrial Revolution in the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was then - in 1859 - that the oil industry was born, combining oil production and refining. Pennsylvania Rock Oil, the first oil producing company in the state of Pennsylvania, was founded in that year.
            </div>

            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                Oil was first used to make kerosene, which was used for table lamps, for example. Then came fuel, which became in demand with the development of the automobile, railroad, and aviation industries. Thus gasoline replaced gas and steam engines.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                By the end of the 20th century, the role of oil began to decline noticeably: alternative sources of fuel and energy appeared, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution is based on completely different factors. The main "engines of progress" are now digital, and the global industry is striving for the most environmentally friendly alternatives to oil.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                We still don't know how oil is formed. There are two theories: organic and inorganic. Proponents of the first believe that hydrocarbons appeared in ancient times from organic matter and plankton under the influence of high temperatures and pressure. Others believe that oil was formed at great depth in the Earth's mantle due to complex chemical reactions. But both theories say that oil is renewable.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                There are other, renewable energy sources. It is to them that the largest energy-consuming countries are switching, considering this method of energy generation more environmentally friendly. The second reason for switching to alternative sources is to stop depending on the oil powers that use oil for geopolitical purposes.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                For example, wave energy: the source is sea waves.
            </div>

            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                In this case, special modules bob on the waves and generate energy from the motion. In addition to generating cheap electricity, such stations protect the shoreline as well as bridges and supports from destruction. However, their potential is only 2 Terawatt hours per year, they can be dangerous for water traffic and create noise that scares aquatic life.
            </div>

            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                Another example is geothermal energy: the source is heat + water.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                Two wells are dug at depth, one of which is fed with water. It evaporates, being heated from the ground, the steam passes through the second well and is sent through the pipes to the turbines, being cleaned of impurities in the process. This is a fairly stable source of energy, with a potential of 47 Terawatt hours per year. Right now, however, we can only get 2% of that.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                According to the data of analytical company Enerdata, in Norway about 97% of electricity is produced from alternative sources, in New Zealand and Brazil - about 80%, in Germany, Italy, Spain and Great Britain - 30-40%. In Russia the share of consumption is 17.2%.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                About other renewable energy sources, we told you in our previous articles.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">

                When will we give up oil?
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                Today oil is still the world's No. 1 fuel: its share of consumption is 31%, higher than coal, gas and renewables. But it is 14% less than it was in the early 1970s, at the height of the industrial economy. This is partly due to restrictions on oil production, first introduced by OPEC in 1973 to combat the oil crisis.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text content__text--mb-sm">
                Some experts believe that by 2050 the demand for crude oil will decrease to 14 million barrels per day. And consumption of crude oil for energy needs will drop from 11 to 4 million barrels per day. The fact that international organizations aim to recycle up to 75% of all plastic will also play a role in the drop in demand. This, in its turn, will reduce the need for new plastic products that are also produced from petroleum products.
            </div>
            <div class="content__text">
                But everyone agrees that the oil industry is going through one of its most difficult periods since the 1960s. The peak in demand for oil has already been passed, and for gas it will come in the next 5 years. The oil market strategy will certainly change. But we will see the global refusal of oil not earlier than in 20-30 years, including due to ecological factors.

                            The energy problem today is one of the most pressing for all mankind. Traditional sources such as oil, gas and other fossil fuels are gradually losing their relevance as they cause enormous damage to the environment. That is why all kinds of solar panels, wind and hydroelectric power plants, as well as bioreactors are becoming so popular today.

                            The main advantage of absolutely all alternative energy sources is their ecological compatibility. In other words, there are no harmful emissions into the atmosphere during operation of such plants. Even an accident at a wind, solar or any other alternative power plant will only lead to material losses of its owners, but will not cause a global environmental disaster, as it can happen, for example, with a nuclear power plant.
